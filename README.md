# SwiftUIForge 🚀

SwiftUIForge is a single, evolving SwiftUI project built to learn **Swift and SwiftUI from beginner to advanced concepts** in a clean, structured, and scalable way.

Instead of creating multiple small demo apps, this repository contains **all concepts organized inside one well-structured project**, making it easy to learn, revisit, and grow over time.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn **Swift fundamentals** and **SwiftUI** step by step
- Follow a **real-world project structure**
- Understand **modern iOS development patterns**
- Practice clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Build a long-term **reference project** for SwiftUI

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- One concept per screen
- Simple examples with clear intent
- Feature-based folder organization
- App itself acts as a **learning hub**
- Code improves as knowledge improves

## 📁 Folder Explanation

### **App**
- Application entry point
- `AppEntryView` acts as a **menu** to navigate learning sections

---

### **Core**
Shared logic used throughout the app:
- **Models** – Data models
- **Services** – Business logic
- **Networking** – API and networking layer
- **Persistence** – Local storage (UserDefaults, CoreData, etc.)
- **Utilities** – Helpers and constants

---

### **Fundamentals**
Beginner concepts:
- Swift basics (variables, functions, optionals, structs, enums)
- SwiftUI basics (views, modifiers, layouts, buttons)

---

### **Intermediate**
Intermediate SwiftUI topics:
- State management and data flow
- Navigation patterns
- Lists and grids

---

### **Advanced**
Advanced and real-world concepts:
- Animations and transitions
- Concurrency (`async/await`)
- Networking
- Architecture patterns (MVVM)

---

### **Components**
Reusable UI components shared across the app.

---

### **Extensions**
Swift extensions to keep code clean and reusable.

---

### **Resources**
Assets and SwiftUI preview content.
