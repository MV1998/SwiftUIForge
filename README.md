# SwiftUIForge 🚀

SwiftUIForge is a single, evolving SwiftUI project built to learn **Swift and SwiftUI from beginner to advanced concepts** in a clean, structured, and scalable way.

Instead of creating multiple small demo apps, this repository contains **all concepts organized inside one well-structured project**, making it easy to learn, revisit, and grow over time.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn **Swift fundamentals** and **SwiftUI** step by step
- Follow a **real-world project structure**
- Understand **modern iOS development patterns**
- Practice clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Build a long-term **reference project** for SwiftUI

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- One concept per screen
- Simple examples with clear intent
- Feature-based folder organization
- App itself acts as a **learning hub**
- Code improves as knowledge improves

## 📁 Folder Explanation

### **App**
- Application entry point
- `AppEntryView` acts as a **menu** to navigate learning sections

---

### **Core**
Shared logic used throughout the app:
- **Models** – Data models
- **Services** – Business logic
- **Networking** – API and networking layer
- **Persistence** – Local storage (UserDefaults, CoreData, etc.)
- **Utilities** – Helpers and constants

---

### **Fundamentals**
Beginner concepts:
- Swift basics (variables, functions, optionals, structs, enums)
- SwiftUI basics (views, modifiers, layouts, buttons)

---

### **Intermediate**
Intermediate SwiftUI topics:
- State management and data flow
- Navigation patterns
- Lists and grids

---

### **Advanced**
Advanced and real-world concepts:
- Animations and transitions
- Concurrency (`async/await`)
- Networking
- Architecture patterns (MVVM)

---

### **Components**
Reusable UI components shared across the app.

---

### **Extensions**
Swift extensions to keep code clean and reusable.

---

### **Resources**
Assets and SwiftUI preview content.

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Run on Simulator or real device
4. Use the main menu to explore concepts
5. Add new views as you learn

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Xcode
- iOS (latest stable version)

---

## 🚧 Status

This project is a **work in progress** and will evolve as new concepts are learned.

Refactoring and improvements are expected and encouraged.

---

## 📌 Notes

- This is a **learning-focused project**
- Code quality improves over time
- Earlier implementations may be revisited and improved later

---

## 📚 Inspiration

Inspired by the idea of learning SwiftUI through **one growing project instead of many throwaway demos**.
